## Chat Conversation

**Question:** How was the overall performance of the sprint?

**User Response:** It was a good sprint! 5/5

---

**Question:** What was good? Please mention everything separately.

**User Response:** All tasks were completed with no major bugs and the AH release went well.

---

**Question:** What was challenging or difficult? Please mention everything separately.

**User Response:** It was difficult to manage different types of FE tests in one specific task. I got different iterations with the same ticket, so I had to go back to this ticket and prepare this case scenario. I'll say some errors were there before the implementation, so, I think it is good to cover more scenarios with tests.

**Question:** What did you learn or experience?

**User Response:** Talking with other FE devs was really helpful. Maybe we can gather time to time to speak about FE topics

---

**Question:** Is there anything you could change in the future sprint?

**User Response:** I think we can update some AH documentation
