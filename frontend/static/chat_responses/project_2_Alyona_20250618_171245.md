## Chat Conversation

**Question:** How was the overall performance of the sprint?

**User Response:** 1. Sprint performance was intense.
We had a lot of meetings regarding the AOS integration, and we were unable to complete one of the tasks because AOS could not provide the necessary information.
We also encountered issues with the PIO API, which prevented us from releasing another task - instead, we had to open a support request.

The release went smoothly.
